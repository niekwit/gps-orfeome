## Description

`GPSW` is a tool for analysing Global Protein Stability Profiling data.

It can deal with two types of experiments:
1. **Protein stability profiling** using Protein Stability Index (PSI) as a metric, which is calculated from the proportion of reads across multiple bins. Publications that include this type of data are [Koren et al. Cell 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29779948/) and [Timms et al. Science 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31273098/).

2. **Pairwise comparison** of ORF counts between two conditions using MAGeCK/DrugZ
